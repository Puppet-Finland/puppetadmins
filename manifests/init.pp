#
# == Class: puppetadmins
#
# A simple class for setting up a Puppet master into a state where several 
# system administrators can manage it simultaneously. Primarily targeted at 
# sites where the same Puppet modules are developed by several people using 
# their own user accounts.
#
# The technical implementation uses Extended POSIX ACLs; more details are 
# available in the puppetadmins::acls class. Optimally the puppetadmins::acls 
# part should be split into a separate module, but that's a future project.
#
# Note that the actual administrator user objects have to be managed outside 
# this module. In particular, the module assumes they're created by a private 
# class called "localusers", which sets up (admin) users and groups. Without 
# that explicit localusers dependency Puppet runs would initially fail.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*admingroup*]
#   Group into which the Puppet administrators belong. The group will not be 
#   created if it does not exist.
# [*confdir*]
#   The Puppet configuration directory. Defaults to '/etc/puppet'.
# [*envdir*]
#   The Puppet environment directory. Defaults to '/etc/puppet/environments'.
